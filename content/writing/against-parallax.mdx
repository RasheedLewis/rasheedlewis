Motion on the web often falls into the trap of decoration. We see things move because they *can*, not because they *should*.

Parallax scrolling is the worst offender. It breaks the 1:1 relationship between the user's input (scroll) and the interface's output (movement). This disconnection causes cognitive friction, however subtle.

In my work, I enforce a strict rule: **Usage of motion must map to state changes.**

If an element moves, it must be because:
1. It is entering the viewport (continuity).
2. It is changing state (interaction).
3. It is leaving the viewport (cleanup).

Anything else is noise.
