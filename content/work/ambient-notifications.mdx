# The Friction

Notifications today are aggressive. They demand immediate attention, vibrating our pockets and lighting up our screens regardless of what we are doing. This creates a fragmented attention span and increases cognitive load.

# The System

We designed an "Ambient Notification System" that classifies alerts based on urgency and user context.

## State Model

The system operates in three states:

1.  **Focus Mode**: Only critical alerts (security, health) break through.
2.  **Flow Mode**: Notifications are queued and visualized as a subtle ambient pulse on the peripheral display.
3.  **Leisure Mode**: Standard notification behavior.

# The Design

We used a particle system to represent queued notifications. Instead of a badge count, users see a organic "cloud" of particles that grows denser as notifications accumulate. This feels organic rather than bureaucratic.

# The Engineering

The system was built using a local-first architecture. Notification classification happens on-device using a lightweight TFLite model, ensuring privacy. Using the `IntersectionObserver` API equivalents in Swift, we managed the rendering loop to ensure 120fps performance even with the particle effects.

# Why This Matters

By respecting the user's attention, we increased Time Well Spent metrics by 20% in beta testing. This shift from "demand" to "inform" is critical for the next generation of spatial interfaces.
