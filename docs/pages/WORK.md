The **Work index** should feel like a *table of systems*, not a gallery.

Below is a **complete design + content spec** you can hand directly to the agent.

---

# Work Index Page — Design & Content Spec

## Purpose (Non-Negotiable)

The Work index exists to:

* prove you build **systems**, not artifacts
* invite *intentional reading*, not browsing
* filter out casual viewers

This page should feel closer to:

* an internal platform index
* a systems review docket

Not:

* a portfolio grid
* a project gallery
* a marketing page

---

## Page Title Block

### Title (Lalezar)

**Selected Systems**

Rules:

* Not “Projects”
* Not “Work”
* “Selected” signals restraint
* “Systems” signals depth

---

### Intro Line (Inter)

A small number of applied systems exploring continuity, interruption, and real-world interaction across mobile and spatial surfaces.

Rules:

* One sentence
* Neutral
* No value claims

---

## Layout Structure

```
[ Page Title ]
[ Intro Line ]

[ System Entry ]
[ System Entry ]
[ System Entry ]
```

No cards.
No grid.
Vertical list only.

Each entry is a **row**, not a tile.

---

## System Entry Design

Each system entry has **four aligned columns** (responsive stack on mobile):

```
[ Title ]  [ Friction ]  [ Focus ]  [ Year ]
```

### Column Behavior

* **Title** → dominant
* **Friction** → explanatory
* **Focus** → taxonomy
* **Year** → understated

---

## Exact Column Content Rules

### 1. Title (Lalezar or Inter Semibold)

Example:

> Hands-Free Task Continuity

Rules:

* No metaphors
* No cleverness
* Reads like an internal doc heading

Clickable → case study page.

---

### 2. Friction (Inter)

Example:

> In-motion workers are forced to repeatedly stop and re-orient to complete simple tasks.

Rules:

* Describes the *problem*, not the solution
* Must reference a **real-world constraint**
* No “improves”, “enhances”, “reimagines”

---

### 3. Focus (Inter, Muted)

Example:

* Mobile Systems
* Spatial UX
* Interruption Handling
* AI-Assisted Flow

Rules:

* 2–4 tags max
* Taxonomy, not marketing labels
* Consistent vocabulary across all entries

---

### 4. Year (Inter, Muted)

Example:

> 2025

Rules:

* Right-aligned on desktop
* Low contrast
* Informational only

---

## Example Entries (Use These as Canonical Models)

### Entry 1

**Hands-Free Task Continuity**
In-motion workers are forced to repeatedly stop and re-orient to complete simple tasks.
Mobile Systems · Interruption Handling · Spatial UX
2025

---

### Entry 2

**Glance-Based Spatial Navigation**
Traditional navigation interfaces demand sustained visual attention in environments that require motion and awareness.
Spatial UX · Sensor-Aware Design · State Modeling
2025

---

### Entry 3

**AI-Assisted Task Resumption**
Users returning to interrupted tasks are often forced to manually reconstruct context that the system already knows.
AI-Assisted Flow · State Recovery · Mobile Systems
2024

---

## Interaction & Motion

### Hover / Focus

* Subtle opacity increase
* Optional underline on title
* No translation
* No elevation
* No shadow

If the row “moves,” it’s wrong.

---

### Click

* Standard page transition
* No animated route theatrics

---

## Color Usage

* Base text: warm off-white
* Muted text: reduced opacity
* Scarlet:

  * Optional underline on active title
  * Optional focus indicator on hover

Scarlet should never appear on **all** rows simultaneously.

---

## Spacing Rules (Strict)

* Space between entries: `space-section`
* Internal row padding: `space-default`
* Page margins: `space-page`

If the list feels dense → increase spacing, not font size.

---

## Filtering (Optional, If Implemented)

If tags are interactive:

* Single-select only
* No animation
* No “All” button (default state is all)

Filtering must feel **analytical**, not playful.

---

## What This Page Communicates (Implicitly)

To a Staff+ reviewer, this page says:

* You choose problems deliberately
* You name work precisely
* You understand constraints
* You are comfortable showing *less*

That is exactly the signal you want.

---

## Agent Acceptance Checklist — Work Index

The agent must confirm:

* Does this read like a systems index, not a gallery?
* Are problems framed before solutions?
* Is restraint visible in quantity and presentation?
* Would this feel appropriate in an internal platform review?

If not → simplify further.
